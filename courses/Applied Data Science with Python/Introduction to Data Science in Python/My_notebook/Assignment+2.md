# Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.
## Part 1
The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning. 

The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.


```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2]=='01':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='02':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='03':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1]=='â„–':
        df.rename(columns={col:'#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(') # split the index by '('

df.index = names_ids.str[0] # the [0] element is the country name (new index) 
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3] # the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)

df = df.drop('Totals')
df.head()
```

### Question 0 (Example)

What is the first country in df?

*This function should return a Series.*


```python
# You should write your whole answer within the function provided. The autograder will call
# this function and compare the return value against the correct solution value
def answer_zero():
    # This function returns the row for Afghanistan, which is a Series object. The assignment
    # question description will tell you the general format the autograder is expecting
    return df.iloc[0]

# You can examine what your function returns by calling it in the cell. If you have questions
# about the assignment formats, check out the discussion forums for any FAQs
answer_zero() 
```




    # Summer           13
    Gold                0
    Silver              0
    Bronze              2
    Total               2
    # Winter            0
    Gold.1              0
    Silver.1            0
    Bronze.1            0
    Total.1             0
    # Games            13
    Gold.2              0
    Silver.2            0
    Bronze.2            2
    Combined total      2
    ID                AFG
    Name: Afghanistan, dtype: object



### Question 1
Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?

*This function should return a single string value.*


```python
def answer_one():
    return df['Gold'].argmax()
```




    'United States'



### Question 2
Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?

*This function should return a single string value.*


```python
def answer_two():
    return abs(df['Gold'] - df['Gold.1']).argmax()
```

### Question 3
Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count? 

$$\frac{Summer~Gold - Winter~Gold}{Total~Gold}$$

Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.

*This function should return a single string value.*


```python
def answer_three():
    only_gold_SW = (df.where ( (df['Gold'] >= 1) & (df['Gold.1'] >= 1) )).dropna()
    return (abs(only_gold_SW['Gold'] - only_gold_SW['Gold.1'])/only_gold_SW['Gold.2']).argmax()
```

### Question 4
Write a function that creates a Series called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal (`Gold.2`) counts for 3 points, silver medals (`Silver.2`) for 2 points, and bronze medals (`Bronze.2`) for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created.

*This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*


```python
def answer_four():
    Points = pd.Series(df['Gold.2']*3 + df['Silver.2']*2 + df['Bronze.2'])
    return Points

answer_four()
```

## Part 2
For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2015/CO-EST2015-alldata.html). Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. [See this document](http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2015/files/CO-EST2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.

The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.

### Question 5
Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)

*This function should return a single string value.*


```python
census_df = pd.read_csv('census.csv')
census_df.head()
```

</div>




```python
def answer_five():
    return census_df['STNAME'].value_counts().argmax()

answer_five()
```




    'Texas'



### Question 6
Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)? Use `CENSUS2010POP`.

*This function should return a list of string values.*


```python
def answer_six():
    copy_df = census_df.copy()
    copy_df = copy_df.groupby(['STNAME'])
    states_pop = pd.DataFrame(columns=['pop'])
    for i, c in copy_df:
        states_pop.loc[i] = [c.sort_values(by='CENSUS2010POP', ascending=False)[1:4]['CENSUS2010POP'].sum()]
    top3 = states_pop.nlargest(3,'pop')
    return list(top3.index)

answer_six()
```




    ['California', 'Texas', 'Illinois']



### Question 7
Which county has had the largest absolute change in population within the period 2010-2015? (Hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all six columns.)

e.g. If County Population in the 5 year period is 100, 120, 80, 105, 100, 130, then its largest change in the period would be |130-80| = 50.

*This function should return a single string value.*


```python
def answer_seven():
    pop = census_df[['STNAME','CTYNAME','POPESTIMATE2015','POPESTIMATE2014','POPESTIMATE2013','POPESTIMATE2012','POPESTIMATE2011','POPESTIMATE2010']]
    pop = pop[pop['STNAME']!=pop['CTYNAME']]

    'Harris County'



### Question 8
In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column. 

Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.

*This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).*


```python
def answer_eight():
    return census_df[(census_df['REGION']<3 ) & (census_df['CTYNAME'] == 'Washington County') & (
            census_df['POPESTIMATE2015']>census_df['POPESTIMATE2014'])][['STNAME','CTYNAME']]
```
